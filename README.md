## Database Structure (Normalized)

The backend uses a **fully normalized MySQL schema** for flexibility and reliability:

```
users
-----
id (PK)
full_name
email
phone

payment_methods
--------------
id (PK)
method

seating_types
-------------
id (PK)
type

bookings
--------
id (PK)
event_name
event_date
ticket_amount
special_requirements
id_image
created_at
user_id (FK ‚Üí users.id)
payment_method_id (FK ‚Üí payment_methods.id)
seating_type_id (FK ‚Üí seating_types.id)

venue_rental_applications
------------------------
id (PK)
company_name
org_type
business_address

All booking, venue rental, and contact insertions use **stored procedures** for safety and performance.
