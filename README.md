id_image
created_at
user_id (FK ‚Üí users.id)
payment_method_id (FK ‚Üí payment_methods.id)
seating_type_id (FK ‚Üí seating_types.id)

venue_rental_applications

## Getting Started

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/gabgabgabgabgabgab11/book-arenafinal.git
    cd book-arenafinal
    npm install
    ```

### 3. Set up Environment Variables

- The repository expects a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory.
- Example `.env` variables you might need (do **not** commit secrets to GitHub):

  ```
  DB_HOST=localhost
  DB_USER=your_username
  DB_PASSWORD=your_password
  DB_NAME=arena_booking
  ```

### 4. Set up the Database

- Import `db_schema.sql` into your MySQL server to create the necessary tables.

### 5. Start the Backend Server

```bash
npm start
```
or
```bash
node app.js
```

### 6. Open the Frontend

- Open `frontend/InfoM/index.html` in your browser to use the application.

## Usage

- **Book an Event:** Go to the booking page and fill out the form with event details.
- **Venue Rental:** On the venue rental page, complete the application form.
- **Contact:** Use the contact form for questions or feedback.

---

## Folder Overview

- `backend/` ‚Äì Node.js/Express server, routes, database logic, and configuration
- `frontend/InfoM/` ‚Äì Static website files (HTML, CSS, JS, images)
- `.gitignore` ‚Äì Ensures `node_modules`, `.env`, and other sensitive or generated files are not tracked

---

## Security & Best Practices

- **Never commit your `.env` file** or any secrets to GitHub. The `.gitignore` file ensures this is not tracked.
- **Do not upload `node_modules/`** ‚Äî use `npm install` to regenerate dependencies.
